# Phase-1-final-project

- The basic story of our application:

    - The application lists out public holidays in selected countries from 2020 to 2030. 
    - The users can use the dropdown function at the top of the webpage to grap the list of holaidys by choosing years and countires. 
    - The users can also click each holidays from the retreived list for detailed information.
    - In the meantime, users can upload local holidays using the form function. 

- The core features of our MVP:
    - A dropdown function that generates holiday list. 
    - A click function that retrevies the detailed information of each holiday, including name and date.
    - A form that allows users to upload holiday of their choices.

- The API data we'll be using:
    - https://date.nager.at/api/v2/publicholidays/${year}/${country}
