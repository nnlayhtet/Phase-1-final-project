# Phase-1-final-project
- The basic story of our application:
    - The application lists out public holidays in selected countries from 2020 to 2030.
    - The users can use the dropdown function at the top of the webpage to grab the list of holidays by choosing years and countries.
    - The users can also click each holidays from the retrieved list for detailed information.
    - In the meantime, users can upload local holidays using the form function.
- The core features of our MVP:
    - A dropdown function that generates holiday list.
    - A click function that retrieves the detailed information of each holiday, including name and date.
    - A form that allows users to upload holiday of their choices.
- The API data we'll be using:
    - https://date.nager.at/api/v2/publicholidays/${year}/${country}
